This fix incorporates suggestions from PPSWeb and Jezmeister as documented here: http://forum.snitz.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=64720&whichpage=1



Jezmeister: you need to add a second check for usergroup which is usually done in inc_header (because at the time there's no member ID) try this (edit, this should work, I think, note I'm assuming from code in this page and inc_header this is enough - i could be wrong but worth a shot)

in post_info find:

if not(IsNull(strSelectSize)) and strSelectSize <> "" then 
	if strSetCookieToForum = 1 then
    		Response.Cookies(strUniqueID & "strSelectSize").Path = strCookieURL
	else
		Response.Cookies(strUniqueID & "strSelectSize").Path = "/"
	end if
	Response.Cookies(strUniqueID & "strSelectSize") = strSelectSize
	Response.Cookies(strUniqueID & "strSelectSize").expires = dateAdd("yyyy", 1, strForumTimeAdjust)
end if



add this below:

if mLev < 1 and strDBNTUserName <> "" then
	'Get userid from strdbntusername
	strSql = "SELECT * FROM "& strTablePrefix &"MEMBERS WHERE M_NAME='"& strDBNTUserName &"'"
	rsid = my_Conn.Execute(strSql)
	MemberID = rsid("MEMBER_ID")
	set rsid = nothing
End if




PPSSWeb: Ok, so the code posted above does work! At least I think it does. Just not where it was said to add it. Instead add it to the same location in Post.asp.

If the user is not logged in, the new code returns MemberID = -1. But nothing in the usergroups mod is set to check for this, so you need to add that bit too.

A little further down the page in Post.asp find:

	'#######    Begin UserGroup MOD     #######	
	if isDeniedMember(strRqForumID,MemberID) = 1 then
		Go_Result "You have been denied access to this forum"
	end if
	if isReadOnly(strRqForumID,MemberID) = 1 then
		Go_Result "Your access to this forum is read-only"
	end if
	'#######     End UserGroup MOD      #######


and replace it with:

	'#######    Begin UserGroup MOD     #######	
	If MemberID < 1 Then
		Go_Result "You must be logged in to Post to this forum"
	End IF
	if isDeniedMember(strRqForumID,MemberID) = 1 then
		Go_Result "You have been denied access to this forum"
	end if
	if isReadOnly(strRqForumID,MemberID) = 1 then
		Go_Result "Your access to this forum is read-only"
	end if
	'#######     End UserGroup MOD      #######
